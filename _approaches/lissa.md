LiSSA is a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generic traceability link recovery. It is empirically evaluated on requirements-to-code, documentation-to-code, and documentation-to-model TLR tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art on code-related tasks.

LiSSA is primarily associated with our [ICSE 2025 publication page](/c/icse25), but is also related to our [REFSQ 2025 publication page](/c/refsq25). See these pages for details, links, and resources.
