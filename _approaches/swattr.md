SWATTR is an extendable, agent-based framework for creating trace links between textual software architecture documentation and models. It extracts text and model information, identifies elements in text, and connects these elements to model elements. SWATTR outperforms baseline approaches and is evaluated on multiple case studies.

See our [ECSA 2021 publication page](/c/ecsa21) for details, links, and resources.
