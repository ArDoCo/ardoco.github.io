# Initial Idea Poster (2019)

Although slightly outdated, the poster below from the [ICSA2019 New and Emerging Ideas (NEMI) Track](https://icsa-conferences.org/2019/call-for-papers/new-and-emerging-ideas/index.html) underlines our main goals for checking consistency between formal architecture artefacts like [Palladio Component Models](https://www.palladio-simulator.com/science/palladio_component_model/) and informal software architecture artefacts in the form of textual software architecture documentation. 
For more details, check the [paper](http://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/keim2019nemi.pdf) as well as the [publications page](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu/Projects_ArDoCo.php?tab=%5B577%5D#tabpanel-577).
